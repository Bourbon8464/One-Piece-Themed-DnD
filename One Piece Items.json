Furthermore, axe dials do not stack with innate weapon bonus stats, and can only increase a weapon's innate bonuses up to a total +3 for attack or damage rolls. However, axe dial bonuses do stack with bonuses from character feats and abilities. For example, a +3 supreme grade meito would receive no benefits from an axe dial and a +2 great grade meito would only increase to a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the weapon if it had a +3 axe dial attached to it."
